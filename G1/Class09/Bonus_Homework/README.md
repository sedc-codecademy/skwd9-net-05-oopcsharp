# Habit Tracker ðŸ§¬
## Introduction ðŸ“š
Creating new good habits and getting rid of the old bad ones can be a real tough job. On average a person needs 66 days to keep or avoid a habit to get it in or out of their system. Of course that is just an average. People vary in the efficiency of tackling habits. One of the ways we can improve this is to track our habits somewhere so we can better understand how much time we are doing something and where can we improve. This is where this habit tracking app comes in the picture. This console application is specifically designed for tracking habits for people that love to use the command line. Our target audience should be mainly programmers, sys-ops, dev-ops and any creature that feels comfortable typing commands instead of clicking buttons.
