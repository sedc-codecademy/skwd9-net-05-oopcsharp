# Exercises

## Task 0:
Create a function that calculates the result of raising an integer to another integer (eg 5 raised to 3 = 5^3 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125).

## Task 1:
Write a function that will give stats about an integer number.
The function should write the stats in console. The stats required are:

* Whats the value of the number 
* How many digits the number has 
* Is the number odd or even 
* Is the number positive 

I.e. if the user enters the number 25, the response should be 
```sh
The number 25 is a 2 digit number, it's odd and it's a positive number.
```

## Task 2:
Create a function to say whether a string is symmetric (a palindrome). For example, "RADAR" is a palindrome.

## Task 3:
Create a function which returns the greatest value stored in an array of real numbers which is specified as parameter.

## Task 4:
Create two functions that calculates the amount of numeric digits and vowels(samoglaski) that a text string contains.

It will accept one parameter parameter: the string that we want to search,

Function 1 should return the number of digits, function 2 should return the number of vowels. Do not name them function1 and 2 :)

## Task 5:
Create a function to read a sentence and replace lowercase characters by uppercase and vice-versa.

## Task 6:
Create a function to check whether a character is an alphabet or not and if so, go to check for the case (upper or lower).

## Task 7:
Create a function to find the number of times a substring appears in a given string.

## Task 8:
Create a function to take one parameter n and calculate what day of the week is n days from this moment.

## Task 9:
Create a function to take one parameter n to display the date of past n years from current date and to tell what day it was. The parameter should not be larger that 20.

## Task 10: 
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns an array of numbers counting down from this number to zero.
* 5 -> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]

## Task 11:
Create a function that takes an array and returns the difference between the biggest and smallest numbers.
* [10, 4, 1, 4, -10, -50, 32, 21] -> 82

## Task 12: 
Create a function that goes through the array, incrementing (+1) for each odd number and decrementing (-1) for each even number and returns that array.
* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [2, 1, 4, 3, 6]

### BONUS

## Task 0:
* Make a method called AgeCalculator
* The method will have one input parameter, your birthday date
* The method should return your age
* Show the age of a user after he inputs a date

> Note: take into consideration if the birthday is today, after or before today
