## Task 1: 
Write a program that will print out all numbers from the range 1-N (N is input from keyboard, N>2) that divide with 3.

## Task 2:
Write a program that will print out all numbers in the range 1-N (N is input from keyboard, N>5) that divide 2 and 3.

## Task 3:
Write a program, which will be calculating the product of the digits of an input number.
## Task 4:
Write a program that will find out the sum of all even numbers in the range 1-N (N is input from keyboard).
## Task 5:
Write a program that will find out the sum of all odd numbers in the range 1-N (N is input from keyboard).
## Task 6:
Write a program that will find out the sum of all numbers that divide 5 in the range 1-N (N is input from keyboard).
## Task 7:
Write a program that will reverse the array {“a”,”b”,”c”,”d”} so that the output is {“d”,“c”,“b”,“a”}.
	- Do NOT use reverse array method :) 
## Task 8:
Write a program that will read two arrays from console input. Then the program has to make a comparison of the arrays and determine whether they are equal or not.
{ 1, 2, 3, 4 } == { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
{ 1, 2, 3, 4 } != { 2, 1, 3, 4 }
## Task 9:
Write a program that will find all numbers in between 1 and 1000, that divide the sum composed of their digits.
## Task 10.
Write a program that will find out all numbers in the range [1 : 1000] that divide the product composed of their digits.
## Task 11:
Write a program that will print out all two-digit numbers, which have the first digit greater than the second digit.
## Task 12: 
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
For each number that is divided by 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number.
For each number that is divided by 5 print “Buzz” instead of the number.
For each number that is divided by 3 and 5  print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

## 🔥🔥 BONUS🔥🔥 
Create a program(game) Guess the number.
The game should be a Console application.
Game rules are for limited tries to guess the number that is randomly generated between two end points.

When the game start it should ask the user for difficulty.
- Easy 
	- In easy mode user should have 9 tries to guess the number between 0-100.
- Normal
	- In normal mode user should have 7 tries to guess the number between 0-500.
- Hard
	- In hard mode user should have 5 tries to guess the number between 0-1000.

Every guess should give the user hint if it is close and also should display the number that the user last entered.
example
* If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 18 it should print out "Your guess is far to high, number entered: 18".
* If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 2 it should print out "Your guess is far to low, number entered: 2".
* If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 7 it should print out "Your guess is a little bit lower, number entered: 7".
* If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 13 it should print out "Your guess is a little bit higher, number entered: 13".
* If the number that should be guessed is 10 and the user enters 10 it should print out "Nailed it. number entered: 10".

You can add your kind of notifications if you like.

Based on how fast the user guessed the number it should display a proper title and the number that should be guessed.
example
If user nails it on the first try it should print out "Lucky guess.".
If user did not guess the number it should print out "Try again".

Optional: Give the user a chance to restart the game(ex Press 1 to start a new game, press 2 to quit game) without starting the project from scratch.

# Good luck and happy coding
